    "*   Aliens share a **tuple**, each element of tuple will be a **string** of alphabets\n",
    "*   Scientists still don't know what is the content of the strings inside the tuples but depending upon the length of the string, the string translates into an alphabet (0 ≡  ,1 ≡ A, 2 ≡ B, 3 ≡ C, .., 26 ≡ Z)\n",
