    "Regex (short for \"regular expression\") is a powerful tool for pattern matching and text manipulation in Python and many other programming languages. It allows you to search for, match, and manipulate strings based on patterns, making it a versatile tool for tasks such as data validation, text parsing, and data extraction. Here's a comprehensive overview of regex functions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " **Basic Regex Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `re.match(pattern, string)`: Attempts to match the pattern only at the beginning of the string.\n",
    "   - `re.search(pattern, string)`: Searches the entire string for a match to the pattern.\n",
    "   - `re.findall(pattern, string)`: Returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string as a list of strings.\n",
    "   - `re.finditer(pattern, string)`: Returns an iterator that produces match objects for all non-overlapping matches of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are a powerful tool for text processing, data extraction, and pattern matching in Python. While they can be extremely useful, they can also become complex, so it's essential to thoroughly test and validate your patterns to ensure they match your desired text."
